# 👋 Hey there, I'm Ogwuche Samuel (Staggs)!

💻 I'm a Computer Science student who loves building things with code.  
🚀 Currently exploring TypeScript, React, and Node.js as I work toward becoming a skilled backend developer.  
🌩️ I’m also fascinated by cloud computing and Machine learning.  

⭐ I believe in learning by doing — one project at a time.
